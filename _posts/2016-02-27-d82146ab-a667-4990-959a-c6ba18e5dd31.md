**ABOUT**

I am one of nine children and raised in the countryside of Victoria, Australia. We had space to run, explore and have adventures. It was a good childhood all in all. If you want to know how to have the best ever Christmas, ask me. I could write the manual. Thanks Mum and Dad. X

I have had an imaginative and creative upbringing, often encouraged and allowed to play for hours utilising materials of nature and household items. Cubby houses, bike riding, yabbying (fishing) exploring caves, tree-climbing, baking, sewing, board games, music, lounge-room concerts, dress-ups, books, and Mass on Sundays. Television was not a big influence,  although I have very fond memories of Sunday's movie matinee with the family and freshly baked cake. Today, I don't own a television and have not owned one for over twenty years.  

Imagination and personal freedom have been my constant companions throughout life, and have helped me to make decisions the rest of the world considered risky. I never felt I had taken risks, I just felt excited about what was coming next!  Someone once described me as 'inquisitive' - this would be one of the most accurately descriptive words for me. 

I take this inquisitive quality into my work as a psychotherapist. It never leaves me, and enables an impersonal approach whilst being both engaged and personal. Observing the endless expressions of life through people is a richly rewarding privilege.
