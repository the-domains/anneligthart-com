**ABOUT**

I am one of nine children, somewhere in the middle and raised in the countryside of Victoria, Australia. We had space to run, explore and have adventures. It was a good childhood all in all. If you want to know how to have the best ever Christmas, ask me. I could write the manual. Thanks Mum and Dad. X

I have had an imaginative and creative upbringing, often encouraged and allowed to play for hours on end utilising materials of nature and household items. Cubby houses, bike riding, yabbying (fishing) exploring caves, tree-climbing, baking, sewing, board games, music, lounge-room concerts, dress-ups, books, and Mass on Sundays. Television not a big influence,  although I have very fond memories of Sunday's movie matinee with the family and freshly baked cake. Today, I don't own a television and have not owned one for over twenty years. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/4a96ccda-56a9-4138-b0f4-67ae69ad9baf.jpg)

While my early twenties were about nursing and scuba diving, my late twenties were all about international travel. I have spent close to twelve years travelling, not all at once. I spent four years living and working in Thailand, where I met my future husband, and together we operated a yacht charter business, whilst living aboard one 45ft ketch. I taught scuba diving as well during this time, and we married there in 1992\. I was 32 years old.

While raising children, I operated a home business in massage and eventually many different types of bodywork. I couldn't envisage putting my children into care whilst working, so I designed work from home for this reason. It went very well, and served us the entire time the children were growing. 

Over the years, I also learned about the work of Rudolf Steiner, and our children attended Steiner schools. I now use Anthroposophic Psychotherapy as one of the spiritual methodology's in my practice. This work matches up very well with Process Oriented Psychology.
