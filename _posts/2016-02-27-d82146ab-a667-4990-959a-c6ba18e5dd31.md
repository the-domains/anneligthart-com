I am one of nine children and raised in the countryside of Victoria, Australia. We had space to run, explore and have adventures. It was a good childhood all in all. If you want to know how to have the best ever Christmas, ask me. I could write the manual. Thanks Mum and Dad. X

I have had an imaginative and creative upbringing, often encouraged and allowed to play for hours utilising materials of nature and household items. Cubby houses, bike riding, yabbying (fishing) exploring caves, tree-climbing, baking, sewing, board games, music, lounge-room concerts, dress-ups, books, and Mass on Sundays. Television was not a big influence, although I have very fond memories of Sunday's movie matinee with the family and freshly baked cake. Today, I don't own a television and cannot sit for long in front of any screen even the cinema screen, without becoming restless. It's just not natural. 

For a period of nine years, I have been immersed in water, both as an avid swimmer, teacher of swimming and then ultimately a professional scuba diver. I remember when we were participating in the Instructor training, the trainer asked each candidate why they loved diving, and the most apt answer I could find was that I simply loved floating; being in a column of water, just floating. 

Imagination and personal freedom have been my constant companions throughout life, and have helped me to make decisions the rest of the world considered risky. I never felt I had taken risks, I just felt excited about things. Someone once described me as 'inquisitive' - this would be one of the most accurate words for me. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/d138109f-729b-4108-af27-d91d5a2d748f.jpg)

I take this inquisitive quality into my work as a psychotherapist. It never leaves me, and enables an impersonal approach whilst being both engaged and personal. Observing the endless expressions of life through people is a richly rewarding privilege. The desire to learn and know and experience I take into research as well, and with each client I look deeply into many resources, as well as my own spiritual practices, to gain clarity and inspiration.
