## A STORY ABOUT AWARENESS, DESIRE AND CHANGE

ONCE upon a time, there were three friends. Their names were Awareness, Desire, and Change. . So close were they it was sometimes impossible to see where one ended and the other began. Now this can be a cosy and snug existence, with good friends. Sharing and supporting and noticing and laughing together. And as life will invariably have it, even between the best of friends, sometimes being a little sharp. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/c97594c6-3cc0-45ce-8697-fb9b9b17692f.jpg)

Strongly aligned with the wisdom and guiding principles of Nature, I recognise that we are undeniably connected, bearing the same signatures, and unfolding processes. When we come together in a session therefore, I utilise this knowledge to underpin our work together. 

My training is predominantly in Process Oriented Psychology, and Anthroposophy, both methodologies utilising natural and deeply spiritual principles thats wisdom is innately resonant with the human being. In times where a lot of our anxiety, confusion, disconnect and conflict are overwhelming, my work can bring a sense of anchoring and a return to a sense of what is actually most important. My strongest processes are in Anchoring, Grounding, and Securing. The strongest call from those who seek my help is a call from a perceived sense of disconnect, isolation, and despair. 

Emphasis is on the process and journey itself. All too often we feel urged to race towards the bit where we get to feel better; to be relieved of this awful angst. But this awful bit is as important if not paramount, in the process of becoming. Holistic Psychotherapy is an opportunity for you to deeply love yourself, by seeing yourself reflected in the world around you and recognising it's staggering beauty and importance. You are that beauty and importance. When you can glimpse that with your heart, really feel that in your bones, you are connecting to what is most important. 

Knowing in the head, and knowing in the heart then become clearly and personally defined.
