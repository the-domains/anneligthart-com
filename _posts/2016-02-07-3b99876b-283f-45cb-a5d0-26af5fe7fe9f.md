My work with individuals, couples or groups is an experience in making change where change is desired. It's a creative experience where we collaborate towards a common goal.  It's something we do together, it's not a service where you sit passively and soak up advice. You get to participate actively in the growth process, and feel yourself return again to life's flow. 

Strongly aligned with the wisdom and guiding principles of nature, I take this into my practice recognising that we are of nature. Bearing the same signatures, and revolving in cyclic and unfolding processes, we come together as natural beings, and begin our unfolding process. 

My training is in Process Oriented Psychology, and Anthroposophy, both methodologies utilising natural principles and anchoring us again into the boundless wisdom therein.  In times where a lot of our anxiety, confusion, disconnect and conflict are overwhelming, my work can bring a sense of anchoring and a return to a sense of what is actually important. More important than anything else.  

Emphasis is on a return to a sense of being at home in the Self. A sense of inner peace, a sense that everything is ok, and going to be ok. This is a felt sense. Not more information or knowledge to file away in an already crammed head...but something closer to the Heart. 

Knowing in the head, and knowing in the heart then become clearly and personally defined.
