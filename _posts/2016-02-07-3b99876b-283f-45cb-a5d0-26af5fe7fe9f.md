My work with individuals, couples or groups is an interactive and creative experience in making change where change is desired.   It's something we do together, it's not a service where you sit passively and soak up advice. You get to participate actively in the process, and make a journey of new awarenesses. 

Strongly aligned with the wisdom and guiding principles of Nature, I recognise that we are undeniably connected, bearing the same signatures, and unfolding processes. When we come together in a session therefore, I utilise this knowledge to underpin our work together. 

My training is in Process Oriented Psychology, and Anthroposophy, both methodologies utilising natural and deeply spiritual principles and anchoring us again into the their breadth of wisdoms.  In times where a lot of our anxiety, confusion, disconnect and conflict are overwhelming, my work can bring a sense of anchoring and a return to a sense of what is actually most important.  My strongest processes are in Anchoring, Grounding, and Securing. The strongest call from those who seek my help is a call from a perceived sense of disconnect, isolation, and despair. 

Emphasis is on the process and journey itself. All too often we feel urged to race towards the bit where we get to feel better; to be relieved of this awful angst. But this awful bit is as important if not paramount, in the process of becoming.  Holistic Psychotherapy is an opportunity for you to deeply love yourself, by seeing yourself reflected in the world around you and recognising it's staggering beauty and importance. You are that beauty and importance. When you can glimpse that with your heart, really feel that in your bones, you are connecting to what is most important. 

Knowing in the head, and knowing in the heart then become clearly and personally defined.
