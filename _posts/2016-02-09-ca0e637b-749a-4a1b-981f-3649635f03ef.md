TESTIMONIALS

"A day ago I had an online session with Anne Ligthart,(Skype) and I'm still feeling the benefits. Sense of stability and ease - although my circumstances are shifting. Quiet confidence. Good sleep. In a very brief time Anne pinpointed a core fear, held me to the point, and supported me while I did the work. It's made such a difference already. And she's given me strategies to keep helping. Thank you so much, Anne. You're like a magic secret weapon ..." - Kath, New Zealand. April 2015

"I want to get everyone to STOP WHAT YOU'RE DOING!! I have to say a "Hands in the Air" to Anne Ligthart! What an extraordinary experience I have had using Anne's amazing gifts. I first contacted Anne when I needed some help and direction - goodness, I got so much more. Not only did I feel great from her expertise and guidance but I learnt skills which I just wanted to keep learning. I have just completed a 12 hour workshop with Anne and if you don't do it - you're mad!!! I have re-enrolled into Anne's new upcoming classes and I have to say, if there's room - book YOUR place to removing the blocks standing in your way. Do it people - you won't regret doing this for yourself - you'll be so grateful that you did -we all deserve our best life x Go Anne! Thank u Thank u!!" - Helen, Brisbane, Australia, March, 2015\.

Dear Anne, We would like to thank you for all your advice, care, support and kindness over the last months. You have given us strength to handle this situation in the best possible way. I really don't know where we would all be right now without you. You have been available for us...and we appreciate this very much Anne. We will be forever grateful for all you have done to date....with special thanks. - M and S, Melbourne Australia, February 2016\. 

"Sending you lots of love and blessings Anne, and l thank you from the bottom of my heart for this EFT course and your wisdom. Feeling such love and open heartedness in my life, so grateful to you. Hope you have a wonderful Christmas and New year with your family. I will be attending the next lesson on Sykpe. Xo - Kerryl, Victoria Australia.

"I first saw Anne about 7 months ago. I was unsure of my place
in my relationship with my partner, was anxious for my young
family's future, felt a lack of connectedness and on reflection
was very unsteady within myself. My partner and I had tried
relationship counselling previously and did not gain much if
anything from it. We felt that we had failed at this and that
there was no solution to our relationship issues. I was given a
flier for Anne's counselling service and gave it a shot on a
whim motivated by the thought that I would need some
support and guidance through separation. I initially went to
see Anne on my own knowing virtually nothing about her
work practices.

After doing a few sessions with Anne I felt like a weight was
lifting and I was able to start clearing away thoughts and
emotions that had been holding me back from life and
relationships. After sessions I felt invigorated and had clarity.
Sometimes quiet literally things looked brighter and clearer.
The work we did was thorough and Anne used techniques that
suited me perfectly. Anne sensed what I needed from the
sessions and was able to work the session around where I was
at (and my baby!). I felt that Anne actually cared about her
work and about me and my family whilst being professional. I
felt at ease with Anne immediately and was able to share
things with her easily knowing I wasn't being judged. With
the use of movement, drawing, and in particular EFT I could
feel things had shifted within a couple of weeks. As the
sessions progressed my sense of self and what is important to
me became clearer. I felt stronger.

I am able to see where my past experiences and relationships
have influenced my behaviours. There is no judgement or
blame attached to these through the work. In fact the work has
softened my perceptions of these. It is a truly empowering
process as I am able to reflect on difficult past experiences
and relationships with a peaceful sense of inquisition and
reflection. I have let go of feelings of anger and of being a
victim within these relationships. I am able to take

responsibility for the role I play within these relationships
also. This has helped change my approach to difficult
situations in my relationships today. The work we have done
has dug deep into the roots and teased them out. A good
thorough cleanout.! Although the digging and teasing was
deep and going into some sensitive areas I always felt
nourished and a little more free after the sessions.

Through the EFT work and Anne's guidance I have improved
my ability to communicate with others. I am learning to
identify my needs and work towards meeting these. I am able
to express and communicate in a more confident, clear and
less defensive way. I have had several comments about this
from loved ones. I didn't realise how much my perceived
expectations of others dictated my behaviour and direction in
life. I now find myself seeking and creating experiences that
suit my true form and I feel alive. My relationships feel
deeper and richer because I feel like I am myself finally. I can
now honestly say that I love myself now also!

I have let go of things that have been niggling and causing
underlying anxiety for years. I have been able to quieten the
thoughts that create anxiety and self-doubt whilst still
acknowledging them. This quiet space has allowed the good
stuff to come in.

My partner also saw Anne. My partner expresses himself very
differently to me so my expectations were that he would not
gain as much as I did and potentially decide not to see Anne.
He has also found the work to be very beneficial and was
surprised that it has connected with him so much. Anne's
methods connected with my partner's interest in science and
with my interest in the emotional and spiritual side to therapy.
Anne has helped bring us together and taught us how to soften
defences allowing us to listen and see the other person. The
conflict between us has pretty much cleared. If we do have
conflict we have the skills to work through this. We still
disagree on some things but can remain united and process the
challenges better now. We still have challenges and get
frustrated at times but we both are committed to one another
and I honestly think we would be in a very different position
without Anne and her work.

Anne has given us practical skills to use at challenging times
on the spot as well as being able to step back and clearly
reflect on what the broader importance of our lives is. I now
find that I am optimistic about the future when I reflect on it.
We are both feeling stronger within ourselves and can now
come together to support and hold our family.

I love my partner and feel that we are probably for the first
time working towards something beautiful and rich together.
This sounds too good to be true but it has been an amazing
process so far and I am amazed at the progress we have made.
I will continue the journey developing on the skills Anne has
taught me. I am truly grateful to Anne as are my family.!  - Judy, Melbourne, Australia, January 2015
