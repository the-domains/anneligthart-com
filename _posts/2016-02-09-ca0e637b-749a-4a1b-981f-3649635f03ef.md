TESTIMONIALS

"A day ago I had an online session with Anne Ligthart,(Skype)  and I'm still feeling the benefits. Sense of stability and ease - although my circumstances are shifting. Quiet confidence. Good sleep. In a very brief time Anne pinpointed a core fear, held me to the point, and supported me while I did the work. It's made such a difference already. And she's given me strategies to keep helping. Thank you so much, Anne. You're like a magic secret weapon ..."  -  Kath, New Zealand. April 2015

"I want to get everyone to STOP WHAT YOU'RE DOING!! I have to say a "Hands in the Air" to Anne Ligthart! What an extraordinary experience I have had using Anne's amazing gifts. I first contacted Anne when I needed some help and direction - goodness, I got so much more. Not only did I feel great from her expertise and guidance but I learnt skills which I just wanted to keep learning. I have just completed a 12 hour workshop with Anne and if you don't do it - you're mad!!! I have re-enrolled into Anne's new upcoming classes and I have to say, if there's room - book YOUR place to removing the blocks standing in your way. Do it people - you won't regret doing this for yourself - you'll be so grateful that you did -we all deserve our best life x Go Anne! Thank u Thank u!!"  -  Helen, Brisbane, Australia, March, 2015\.

We will be forever grateful for all you have done to date....with special thanks. - M and S, Melbourne Australia, February 2016\.
