description: 'Processwork is an awareness practice that extends and deepens mindfulness as a tool for inner and outer conflict facilitation. Process oriented innerwork brings creativity, playfulness and depth to a regular meditation practice. Training in process-oriented innerwork develops the facilitator’s capacity to explore their own inner experience while working with a client in order to gain insight into the client’s process, and work more effectively with them. It gives the facilitator and leader exceptional tools for managing conflict and bringing out the hidden resources within disturbances. The practice of innerwork, writes Arnold Mindell, means: “… you are able to work with your life process. You feel ‘up to it’, not trampled by it. You feel like a multi-dimensional person. If you work with the conflicts between the processes, following them congruently, step by step, you will notice another aspect of consciousness: the experience of freedom. Imagine your process as a chariot pulled by a lion: freedom is neither being run over by the chariot nor being eaten by the lion. You drive the chariot and steer the lion.” Arnold Mindell (1990, p. 121). 3)'

Because we are physical beings with physical bodies, residing in a physical world, the way through to real change is through the physical. It's not a barrier, it's the medium. The way through.
