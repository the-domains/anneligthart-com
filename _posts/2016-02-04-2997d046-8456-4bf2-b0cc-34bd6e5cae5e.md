SERVICES - The services I offer are grounded in nature, compassion, years of experience, and crossing life's thresholds by the direct route. Consequently, I am grounded, warm, wise and direct. I bring these qualities of myself to a therapeutic forum in order to explore with you growing awareness and support. 

Counselling and Psychotherapy -  Process Oriented Psychology.     Anthroposophic Medicine/Psychotherapy that serves all requests for shared dialogue. 

Intensive work with Addiction - working with individuals and whole families through the passage of this process. 

Mentoring individuals/couples between the ages of 21-42 years of age. 

Emotional Freedom Technique - practice and courses, specifically targetting the process of Self Empowerment, learning powerful and effective skills and providing on-going support. Two courses presently available, an Introduction to Emotional Freedom Technique, and Tapping into Change, a two year program. 

Massage - half hour and one hour sessions, incorporating remedial stretching and breath work. Massage and bodywork is sometimes a direct route to working with emotional expression. 

Text Study and Biographic Study - immersing deeply in the symbolism of the written word, and looking with gentle eyes on your journey through life. 

Paraliminal Recordings, and emWave technology - using the power of computer technology to interact with brainwave entrainment (meaning alignment)  neural pathways, and unconscious beliefs.
