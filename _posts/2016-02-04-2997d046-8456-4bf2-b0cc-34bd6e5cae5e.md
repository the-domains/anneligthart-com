**'One important point I would like to mention is the need to pay attention to the pace of development. All development occurs slowly. The Ahrimanic powers want to accelerate everything. You can see how that is happening everywhere in our time: people often prefer short-term projects and quick results. Ahriman organises that on purpose in order to prevent the human 'I' from reaching a fully conscious relationship with new spiritual capacities. Ahriman wants I-less people, who do not have inner contact with things but, in a way, act automatically. Ahriman strives for a mechanical society. ' - Bernard Lievegoed, - 'The battle for the soul'**

## SERVICES 

The services I offer are grounded in nature, compassion, years of experience, and a steadiness of acquired knowledge. My personal methods are grounded, warm, wise and direct. I bring these qualities of myself to a therapeutic forum in order to explore with you growing awareness and support. 

**Co_unselling and Psychotherapy_**- Process Oriented Psychology, Anthroposophic Medicine/Psychotherapy that underpins all sessions. During this work, we have an array of methods of working involving stories, dreams, drawing and movement to name a few. Sometimes we just talk too. Often I will teach, and usually you will have homework. 

Always we will follow your process, and honour your reality. 

_Individuals and Couples - _ very often we simply need to voice our feelings and concerns to an empathic and attentive professional. Occasionally the need is for mediation, and the bridge to cross can be mutual learning. 

**_Intensive work with Addiction_** -working with individuals and whole families through the passage of this process. Assessment and referral to detox and rehabilitation facilities. 

**_Mentoring _**individuals/couples between the ages of 21-42 years of age.I also work with new parents, in this capacity to assist in the transition from coupledom to a family. 

**_Emotional Freedom Technique_**- practice and courses, specifically targetting the process of Self Empowerment, learning powerful and effective skills and providing on-going support. Two courses presently available, an Introduction to Emotional Freedom Technique, and Tapping into Change, a two year program. 

**_Massage_** - as an adjunct to psychotherapy,incorporating remedial stretching and breath work. Massage and bodywork is sometimes a good additional model to work through some conditions, eg. trauma related conditions. Massage is also understated as a means to deep and lasting calm, when given with sensitivity and without formulae. Thresholds and transitions can be greatly facilitated and supported by the nurturing touch of a massage given with love. 

**_Text Study and Biographic Study_** - immersing deeply in the symbolism of the written word, and looking with gentle eyes on your journey through life. 

**_Paraliminal Recordings, and emWave technology_** - using the power of computer technology to interact with brainwave entrainment (meaning alignment) neural pathways, and unconscious beliefs. We live now in an exciting time of technological advancement, and I utilise some the tools for those who are interested. I have used these tools for myself before offering them to clients, with excellent results. 

_**Tuition**__**for children 5-18 years in Mindfulness practice**_. I am certified by Mindful Schools U.S. (http://www.mindfulschools.org) as a Mindfulness educator for children and youth and conduct trainings for schools and staff, groups and individuals. 

Please contact me for further information on any or all of these services. 

'I believe that thinking only of our own comfort and peace to the neglect of other troubles in the world is immoral. The time has come for us to consider seriously how to change our way of life, not through prayer or religious teaching, but through education. Since moral education is sometimes only superficial, we need to devise a systematic approach to exploring inner values and ways to create a more peaceful world.' - Dalai Lama
