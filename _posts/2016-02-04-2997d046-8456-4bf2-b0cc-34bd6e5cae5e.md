**SERVICES **

The services I offer are grounded in nature, compassion, years of experience, and crossing life's thresholds consciously. Consequently, I am grounded, warm, wise and direct. I bring these qualities of myself to a therapeutic forum in order to explore with you growing awareness and support. 

**Co_unselling and Psychotherapy_**-  Process Oriented Psychology, Anthroposophic Medicine/Psychotherapy that underpins all sessions. 

_Individuals and Couples - _ very often we simply need to voice our feelings and concerns to an empathic and attentive professional. Our sessions are confidential and 

**_Intensive work with Addiction_** -working with individuals and whole families through the passage of this process. Assessment and referral to detox and rehabilitation facilities. 

**_Mentoring _**individuals/couples between the ages of 21-42 years of age. 

**_Emotional Freedom Technique_**- practice and courses, specifically targetting the process of Self Empowerment, learning powerful and effective skills and providing on-going support. Two courses presently available, an Introduction to Emotional Freedom Technique, and Tapping into Change, a two year program. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/c7b650c3-5368-4a41-800d-53aa2f71275e.jpg)

**_Massage_** - as an adjunct to psychotherapy,incorporating remedial stretching and breath work. Massage and bodywork is sometimes a preferable model to work through some conditions, eg. trauma related conditions. Massage is also understated as a means to deep and lasting calm, when given with sensitivity and without formulae. 

**_Text Study and Biographic Study_** - immersing deeply in the symbolism of the written word, and looking with gentle eyes on your journey through life. 

**_Paraliminal Recordings, and emWave technology_** - using the power of computer technology to interact with brainwave entrainment (meaning alignment)  neural pathways, and unconscious beliefs. 

_Tuition__**for children 5-18 years in Mindfulness practice**_. I am certified by Mindful Schools U.S. (http://www.mindfulschools.org) as a Mindfulness educator for children and youth. Wherever there are groups of children and youth, I provide short bi-weekly lessons in Mindfulness  proven to bring rapid and effective change. 

Please contact me for further information on any or all of these services.
