**SERVICES **

The services I offer are grounded in nature, compassion, years of experience, and crossing life's thresholds by the direct route. Consequently, I am grounded, warm, wise and direct. I bring these qualities of myself to a therapeutic forum in order to explore with you growing awareness and support. 

**Counselling and Psychotherapy **-  Process Oriented Psychology, Anthroposophic Medicine/Psychotherapy that underpins all sessions. 

**Intensive work with Addiction** -working with individuals and whole families through the passage of this process. Assessment and referral to detox and rehabilitation facilities. 

**Mentoring **individuals/couples between the ages of 21-42 years of age. 

**Emotional Freedom Technique **- practice and courses, specifically targetting the process of Self Empowerment, learning powerful and effective skills and providing on-going support. Two courses presently available, an Introduction to Emotional Freedom Technique, and Tapping into Change, a two year program. 

**Massage** - half hour and one hour sessions, incorporating remedial stretching and breath work. Massage and bodywork is sometimes a preferable model to work through some conditions, eg. trauma related conditions. Massage is also understated as a means to deep and lasting calm. 

**Text Study and Biographic Study** - immersing deeply in the symbolism of the written word, and looking with gentle eyes on your journey through life. 

**Paraliminal Recordings, and emWave technology** - using the power of computer technology to interact with brainwave entrainment (meaning alignment)  neural pathways, and unconscious beliefs. 

**Tuition **for children 5-18 years in Mindfulness practice. I am certified by the Mindful Schools (http://www.mindfulschools.org) as a Mindfulness educator for children. 

Please contact me for further information on any or all of these services.
