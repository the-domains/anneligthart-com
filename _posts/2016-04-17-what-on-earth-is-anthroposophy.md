**WHAT ON EARTH IS ANTHROPOSOPHY? **

"Anthroposophy is a path of knowledge aiming to guide the spiritual element in the human being to the spiritual in the universe." - Rudolf Steiner 

The word "anthroposophy" means "wisdom of the human being," or, for us today, "awareness of one's humanity."
Knowledge of spirit can only be found by spiritual means. Anthroposophy offers an inner path of schooling to attain such knowledge. It takes its starting point from modern critical consciousness and our contemporary orientation toward technology and science. It is a kind of study and schooling that leads to concrete experience of the spiritual dimensions of the human being and the world.
Spiritual knowledge can be fruitful in various fields of life -- in art, religion and science. Examples are education, medicine, pharmacy, agriculture, social work, economics and much else. Over time, about 10,000 institutions and initiatives have been founded that endeavor to apply anthroposophy: schools (often called Rudolf Steiner schools, Waldorf schools or independent schools), homes, workshops and schools working within curative education and social therapy, clinics, doctor's practices, pharmaceutical companies, biodynamic farms, banks, art schools, stage groups, businesses, etc. The thing that connects these endeavors to the Goetheanum is their mutual basis in anthroposophy.

Rudolf Steiner 1861-1925

Rudolf Steiner was born on February 27, 1861 in what is now Croatia and died on March 30, 1925 in Dornach, Switzerland.
Words to describe the work of Rudolf Steiner: unusual -- not easy to approach -- filled with stimulating ideas. His monumental projects of drafting an alternative science, a new pedagogy, new perspectives in medicine and agriculture have entered into the spiritual heritage of the present time. They live in today's cultural life as an impulse and an inspiration.
The philosopher, scientist and Goethe scholar Rudolf Steiner developed Anthroposophy as a «science of the spirit.» An individual path of spiritual development, Christcentered at its esoteric core, its fruits are visible in art, social forms and practical initiatives.

**Anthroposophic med****icines: **

**Medicine discovery, preparation and use** are based on the anthroposophic understanding of the human being and nature. The mistletoe preparations for cancer treatment created through such an approach -- Abnoba viscum(r), Helixor(r), Iscador(r), Iscucin(r), -- are particularly well known in this respect.
Therapeutic procedures: 

**Therapeutic sculpture** (clay modelling), therapeutic painting, therapeutic creative speech, music and singing therapy. 

**Eurythmy** therapy introduced into medicine as a new movement therapy. 

**Rhythmical massage **- the rhythmical application of ointments, as well as many different very effective external applications in nursing. 

**A special form of gymnastics** for patients based on Bothmer gymnastics, which has been in existence since the 1920s, is being developed as therapeutic Bothmer gymnastics and Spatial Dynamics. 

**Pyschotherapy and biography work**, including advice on self-development and meditative training.
Internationally recognised therapy programme for addiction. 

Close collaboration with educationalists, support for school physicians, and worldwide practice of the anthroposophic conception of support based on curative education and social therapy in over 350 facilities, including the Camphill movement in 26 European and 12 other countries worldwide.
