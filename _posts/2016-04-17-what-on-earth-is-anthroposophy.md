**WHAT ON EARTH IS ANTHROPOSOPHY? **

"Anthroposophy is a path of knowledge aiming to guide the spiritual element in the human being to the spiritual in the universe." - Rudolf Steiner 

The word "anthroposophy" means "wisdom of the human being," or, for us today, "awareness of one's humanity."
Knowledge of spirit can only be found by spiritual means. Anthroposophy offers an inner path of schooling to attain such knowledge. It takes its starting point from modern critical consciousness and our contemporary orientation toward technology and science. It is a kind of study and schooling that leads to concrete experience of the spiritual dimensions of the human being and the world.
Spiritual knowledge can be fruitful in various fields of life -- in art, religion and science. Examples are education, medicine, pharmacy, agriculture, social work, economics and much else. Over time, about 10,000 institutions and initiatives have been founded that endeavor to apply anthroposophy: schools (often called Rudolf Steiner schools, Waldorf schools or independent schools), homes, workshops and schools working within curative education and social therapy, clinics, doctor's practices, pharmaceutical companies, biodynamic farms, banks, art schools, stage groups, businesses, etc. The thing that connects these endeavors to the Goetheanum is their mutual basis in anthroposophy.
