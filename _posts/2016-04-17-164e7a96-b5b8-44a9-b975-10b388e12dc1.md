WHAT ON EARTH IS PROCESS ORIENTED PSYCHOLOGY? 

Process Oriented Psychology (Process Work) is a cross-disciplinary approach to facilitate individual and collective change. It offers new ways of working with human difficulties, including emotional disturbances, physical illness or symptoms, relationships, and larger community conflicts.
Process Work has its philosophical roots in Jungian Psychology, Chinese Taoism, and the Shamanism of many indigenous peoples.
Jungian psychology provides much of the therapeutic underpinning of Process Work, particularly its 'teleological approach' - that raw experiences may yield meaning and purpose when amplified in a manner appropriate to the situation, as determined by the constant observation of the effects this amplification produces. Taoism supports an appreciation of the natural state of all things and faith in the inherent rightness of events no matter how harmful or pathological they may appear at first glance. From Shamanism comes the basic concern with the value of unexpected and unintended events and a willingness to allow and be guided by altered states of awareness.
Process Work was founded and initially developed by Dr Arnold Mindell, a Jungian analyst then based in Zurich. In 1969 he realized that body experiences and symptoms mirror dreams and are meaningful expressions of the unconscious. He used the term \`dreaming body' (later 'dreambody) to identify the numinous underlying process expressing itself through both dreams and the body. Together with his colleagues and students, Mindell has continued to research how the \`dream', the \`living unconscious in its momentary expression', is constantly found in every aspect of our lives.
This work has repeatedly showed how physical body symptoms, addictions, family and relationship problems, group conflicts and social tensions all mirror our night time dreams, and vice versa : all these experiences, even the most chaotic-seeming processes, when approached with curiosity and respect, reveal an inner order and coherence that can bring new information vital for our personal and collective growth.
