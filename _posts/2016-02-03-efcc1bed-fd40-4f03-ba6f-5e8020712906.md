**Welcome! **This site, my site is a place where you will be invited to go on an exploration below the surface. Exploration invariably leads to uncovering, and uncovering often leads to change.  It's exciting! Sometimes intrepid, always interesting and usually illuminating.   We work towards expansion of awareness, joining and an experience in growth. 

Psychotherapy extends in many directions and in Process Work we reach beyond the known reality into realms of imagination, dreaming and quantum terrains. We look for and honour your processes at work in these places as well as those that we can see hear and touch. 

Through an applied Anthroposophic methodology, we are able to work with innate wisdom of the developing human being, and bring a broad and global perspective to your experience. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/89aa2df7-1604-40fc-acc7-b943b53b6524.jpg)

Maybe you want to explore optional ways of looking at your career, income, relationships, health, community. We can turn that whole desire upside down and inside out to find the prefect perspective that suits. 

Sometimes it's simply a matter of being heard. 

Whatever the reason we come together, I open to you the warmest of welcomes. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/6ee8c4c7-c06a-44fd-be6e-d5e09c11f602.jpg)
