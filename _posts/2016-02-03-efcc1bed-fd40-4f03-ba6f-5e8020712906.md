**Welcome! **This site, my site is a place where you will be invited to go on an exploration. Exploration invariably leads to uncovering, and uncovering often leads to change.  It's exciting! Sometimes intrepid, always interesting and usually illuminating.   We work towards expansion of awareness, joining and an experience in growth. 

Psychotherapy extends in many directions and in Process Work we reach beyond the known reality into realms of imagination, dreaming and quantum terrains. We look for and honour your processes at work in these places as well as those that we can see hear and touch. 

Through an applied Anthroposophic methodology, we are able to work with innate wisdom of the developing human being, and help to bring a much broader and global perspective to the reasons for your visit. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/89aa2df7-1604-40fc-acc7-b943b53b6524.jpg)

Maybe you want to explore optional ways of looking at your career, income, relationships, health, community. We can turn that whole desire upside down and inside out to find the prefect perspective that suits. 

Sometimes it's simply a matter of being heard. 

Whatever the reason we come together, I open to you the warmest of welcomes. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/6ee8c4c7-c06a-44fd-be6e-d5e09c11f602.jpg)

"**The purpose of life seems to be to acquaint a man with himself ..**

..and whatever science or art or course of action he engages in reacts upon and illuminates the recesses of his own mind. Thus friends seem to be only mirrors to draw out and explain to us ourselves; and that which draws us nearer our fellow man, is, that the deep Heart in one, answers the deep Heart in another, -- that we find we have a common Nature -- one life which runs through all individuals.." - Ralph Waldo Emerson
