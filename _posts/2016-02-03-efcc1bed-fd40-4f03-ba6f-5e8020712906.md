Welcome to AnneLigthart.com.  This site is going to take you on a journey of what change is possible for YOU and how to go about it. If it's change you want that is....

Or maybe you just want to explore optional ways of looking at your life...your career, income, community, health, relationships...

Sometimes it's simply a matter of being heard. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/f4744e34-24d2-4ea2-b54d-e2d0e8f01df5.jpg)

This site, my site is a place where you will be invited to go on an exploration. Exploration invariably leads to uncovering, and uncovering often leads to change.  It's exciting! Sometimes intrepid, always interesting and usually illuminating.   You get to realise that there is a whole lot more to you, than what you see when you look down at your lap. Across from you, there's often a lot of unexplored terrain in the person next to you as well. We work towards expansion of awareness, joining and an experience in growth. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/89aa2df7-1604-40fc-acc7-b943b53b6524.jpg)

The warmest welcome to you. :)

"The purpose of life seems to be to acquaint a man with himself and whatever science or art or course of action he engages in reacts upon and illuminates the recesses of his own mind. Thus friends seem to be only mirrors to draw out and explain to us ourselves; and that which draws us nearer our fellow man, is, that the deep Heart in one, answers the deep Heart in another, -- that we find we have (a common Nature) -- one life which runs through all individuals, and which is indeed Divine." - Ralph Waldo Emerson
