# Welcome to Anne Ligthart Holistic Counselling and Psychotherapy, Facilitation and Mentoring.

This is a place where you can go on an exploration; a voyage of self discovery. It's exciting! Sometimes intrepid, always interesting and usually illuminating. We work together towards an expansion of awareness and an experience in growth and vision. 

Counselling and Psychotherapy is not initially about the outer world, but about the inner world. As one reflects the other most accurately and generously, the service provided is a companionship in going within. For many, the idea of looking within is at first confusing, and can often feel uncertain. 

Anne Ligthart provides a rich and diverse range of services, all based in the deep wisdom and mystery of nature and all focused on your place within it. She welcomes you warmly and with gratitude.

Anne Ligthart ****extends her services in many directions towards Inner Work, Dreams, Body Symptoms, Relationships, Family, Trauma and Addictions. Recognising what is needed in the moment, will inform what is needed overall. 

Through an applied Anthroposophic lens and Process Work methodology she is able to work with innate wisdom of the developing human being, and bring a broad and global perspective to your experience. 

The two combined form a complementary model which is deeply sensitive and widely supportive of a modern society that now calls for insight, empathy and deep healing. You as the individual are honoured singularly and acknowledged as integral to the whole. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/89aa2df7-1604-40fc-acc7-b943b53b6524.jpg)

From the most complex to the most simple...

Sometimes it's simply a matter of being heard. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/09aa0b81-6664-44aa-a3ca-1a144ecb1783.jpg)

Whatever the reason we come together, I open to you the warmest of welcomes. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/6ee8c4c7-c06a-44fd-be6e-d5e09c11f602.jpg)
