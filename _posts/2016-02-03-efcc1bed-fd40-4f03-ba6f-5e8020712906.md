**Welcome to Anne Ligthart Holistic Counselling and Psychotherapy. **

This site is a safe place where you will go on an exploration; a voyage of self discovery.  It's exciting! Sometimes intrepid, always interesting and usually illuminating.   We work together  towards an expansion of awareness and an experience in growth and vision. 

I provide a rich and diverse range of services, all based in the deep wisdom and mystery of nature and all focused on your place within it.  I welcome you warmly and with gratitude. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/41941f81-d0c6-463e-bc60-4b37f8694a7a.jpg)

**Anne Ligthart Psychotherapy** extends in many directions and in Process Work we reach beyond the known reality into realms of imagination, dreaming and quantum terrains. We look for and honour your processes at work in these places as well as those that we can see hear and touch. 

Through an applied Anthroposophic methodology, we are able to work with innate wisdom of the developing human being, and bring a broad and global perspective to your experience. 

The two combined form a complementary model which is deeply sensitive and widely supportive of a modern society that now calls for healing. You as the individual are honoured singularly and acknowledged as integral to the whole. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/89aa2df7-1604-40fc-acc7-b943b53b6524.jpg)

Maybe you want to explore optional ways of looking at your career, income, relationships, health, community. We can turn that whole desire upside down and inside out to find the prefect perspective that suits. 

Sometimes it's simply a matter of being heard. 

Whatever the reason we come together, I open to you the warmest of welcomes. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/6ee8c4c7-c06a-44fd-be6e-d5e09c11f602.jpg)
