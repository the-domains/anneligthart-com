MINDFULNESS COURSES FOR CHILDREN AND YOUTH, AGED 5  TO 18 YEARS.

In direct response to the witnessing of children in distress, I am now working in Mindfulness, through my own practice and through the teaching of this powerful, and life-changing model. 

Mindfulness courses are held on request also one to one. They can be tailored to suit, with courses for Primary Schools running up to 8 weeks, and courses for High Schools, up to 23 weeks in duration.  

Please contact me for more information. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/941e48d1-543f-4575-92f6-3d233f86f2cb.jpg)
