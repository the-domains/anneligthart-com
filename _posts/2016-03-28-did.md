DID YOU KNOW? 

..that mindfulness is not meditation? Mindfulness practiced will enable meditation to be better, but of itself it is not meditation. It is a practice of paying attention, of directing the flow of thinking, not stopping it, but paying attention to it and directing it's flow. 

...that naming  a feeling, when you are feeling it slows down the feeling itself? For example, if you are feeling anxious, paying attention it by internally saying, "I feel anxious right now"  actually slows down the neurological process causing anxiety. This is one aspect of mindfulness. This is why good communication is often experienced when people can (kindly) speak their minds. Neurologically, they are de-escalating their own feelings. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/76b5ee57-a2a9-4fca-899e-ce6648874cff.jpg)
