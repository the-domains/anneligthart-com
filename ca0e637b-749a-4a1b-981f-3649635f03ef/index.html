<p>TESTIMONIALS</p><p>"A day ago I had an online session with Anne Ligthart,(Skype) and I'm still feeling the benefits. Sense of stability and ease - although my circumstances are shifting. Quiet confidence. Good sleep. In a very brief time Anne pinpointed a core fear, held me to the point, and supported me while I did the work. It's made such a difference already. And she's given me strategies to keep helping. Thank you so much, Anne. You're like a magic secret weapon ..." - Kath, New Zealand.

I have to say a "Hands in the Air" to Anne Ligthart! What an extraordinary experience I have had using Anne's amazing gifts. I first contacted Anne when I needed some help and direction - goodness, I got so much more. Not only did I feel great from her expertise and guidance but I learnt skills which I just wanted to keep learning. I have just completed a 12 hour workshop with Anne and if you don't do it - you're mad!!! I have re-enrolled into Anne's new upcoming classes and I have to say, if there's room - book YOUR place to removing the blocks standing in your way. Do it people - you won't regret doing this for yourself - you'll be so grateful that you did -we all deserve our best life x Go Anne!

<p>"I first saw Anne about 7 months ago. I was unsure of my place in my relationship with my partner, was anxious for my young family’s future, felt a lack of connectedness and on reflection was very unsteady within myself. My partner and I had tried relationship counselling previously and did not gain much if anything from it. We felt that we had failed at this and that there was no solution to our relationship issues. I was given a flier for Anne’s counselling service and gave it a shot on a whim motivated by the thought that I would need some support and guidance through separation. I initially went to see Anne on my own knowing virtually nothing about her work practices. </p><p>After doing a few sessions with Anne I felt like a weight was lifting and I was able to start clearing away thoughts and emotions that had been holding me back from life and relationships. After sessions I felt invigorated and had clarity. Sometimes quiet literally things looked brighter and clearer. The work we did was thorough and Anne used techniques that suited me perfectly. Anne sensed what I needed from the sessions and was able to work the session around where I was at (and my baby!). I felt that Anne actually cared about her work and about me and my family whilst being professional. I felt at ease with Anne immediately and was able to share things with her easily knowing I wasn’t being judged. With the use of movement, drawing, and in particular EFT I could feel things had shifted within a couple of weeks. As the sessions progressed my sense of self and what is important to me became clearer. I felt stronger. </p><p>I am able to see where my past experiences and relationships have influenced my behaviours. There is no judgement or blame attached to these through the work. In fact the work has softened my perceptions of these. It is a truly empowering process as I am able to reflect on difficult past experiences and relationships with a peaceful sense of inquisition and reflection. I have let go of feelings of anger and of being a victim within these relationships. I am able to take </p><p>responsibility for the role I play within these relationships also. This has helped change my approach to difficult situations in my relationships today. The work we have done has dug deep into the roots and teased them out. A good thorough cleanout.! Although the digging and teasing was deep and going into some sensitive areas I always felt nourished and a little more free after the sessions. </p><p>Through the EFT work and Anne’s guidance I have improved my ability to communicate with others. I am learning to identify my needs and work towards meeting these. I am able to express and communicate in a more confident, clear and less defensive way. I have had several comments about this from loved ones. I didn’t realise how much my perceived expectations of others dictated my behaviour and direction in life. I now find myself seeking and creating experiences that suit my true form and I feel alive. My relationships feel deeper and richer because I feel like I am myself finally. I can now honestly say that I love myself now also! </p><p>I have let go of things that have been niggling and causing underlying anxiety for years. I have been able to quieten the thoughts that create anxiety and self-doubt whilst still acknowledging them. This quiet space has allowed the good stuff to come in. </p><p>My partner also saw Anne. My partner expresses himself very differently to me so my expectations were that he would not gain as much as I did and potentially decide not to see Anne. He has also found the work to be very beneficial and was surprised that it has connected with him so much. Anne’s methods connected with my partner’s interest in science and with my interest in the emotional and spiritual side to therapy. Anne has helped bring us together and taught us how to soften defences allowing us to listen and see the other person. The conflict between us has pretty much cleared. If we do have conflict we have the skills to work through this. We still disagree on some things but can remain united and process the challenges better now. We still have challenges and get frustrated at times but we both are committed to one another and I honestly think we would be in a very different position without Anne and her work. </p><p>Anne has given us practical skills to use at challenging times on the spot as well as being able to step back and clearly reflect on what the broader importance of our lives is. I now find that I am optimistic about the future when I reflect on it. We are both feeling stronger within ourselves and can now come together to support and hold our family. </p><p>I love my partner and feel that we are probably for the first time working towards something beautiful and rich together. This sounds too good to be true but it has been an amazing process so far and I am amazed at the progress we have made. I will continue the journey developing on the skills Anne has taught me. I am truly grateful to Anne as are my family.! - Judy, Melbourne, Australia, January 2015</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-white colors-local " data-reactid="20"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="21"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="22"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="23"><span data-reactid="24"><!-- react-empty: 25 --><h2 data-reactid="26"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="27"></a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="28"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="29"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="30"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
