Process oriented innerwork brings creativity, playfulness and depth to a regular meditation practice. Training in process-oriented innerwork develops the facilitator’s capacity to explore their own inner experience while working with a client in order to gain insight into the client’s process, and work more effectively with them. It gives the facilitator and leader exceptional tools for managing conflict and bringing out the hidden resources within disturbances. The practice of innerwork, writes Arnold Mindell, means: “… you are able to work with your life process. You feel ‘up to it’, not trampled by it. You feel like a multi-dimensional person. If you work with the conflicts between the processes, following them congruently, step by step, you will notice another aspect of consciousness: the experience of freedom. Imagine your process as a chariot pulled by a lion: freedom is neither being run over by the chariot nor being eaten by the lion. You drive the chariot and steer the lion.” Arnold Mindell (1990, p. 121). 3)</p><p>'You treat a disease, you win, you lose...</p><p>You treat a person you always win, no matter what the outcome.." </p><p> - Patch Adams. </p><p>RELATIONSHIPS - Couples, families, colleagues, friends. </p><p>Have you ever wondered what is the common ground or deep story that brings people together in relationship? Have you ever wished for more intimacy, more freedom, or just better skills for negotiating conflicts in relationship? Relationships are the source of both our greatest joys and worst suffering. Everywhere we turn are relationships: families, partners, colleagues, teammates, neighbours, enemies … and at some point everyone seems to be impossible! Processwork provides a multi-levelled framework and tools for facilitating your own and others’ relationships. By connecting to the deepest part of ourselves, writes Arnold Mindell, we can open up to the other person and understand their viewpoint: “This is not just switching roles, it is getting deep into yourself, so when you come up, you are a little bit the other person and you can almost feel her or him. This approach makes relationships easier.” Arnold Mindell, (2013, p. 182).1) In particular, Processwork brings attention to the more unknown aspects of relating and teaches how to catch the gifts within irrational, dreamlike experiences, difficult moods, body symptoms and intractable conflicts. Process oriented relationship facilitation includes seeing the relationship as a system, creating a container for the unknown to emerge, and participating in relationship interactions with fluidity, curiosity, and openness. Mindell explains: “When you are yourself and at home in the universe, you can bring others home. Then things start working better. When you are deeply in connection with the processmind, you are home. When you are at home then, because of nonlocality, the other person is likely to be more at home as well.” Arnold Mindell, (2013, p. 182-3).</p><picture>
